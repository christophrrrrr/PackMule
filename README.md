### Stack ridiculous things on a mule. Don't look down.

**Pack Mule** is a 3D physics stacking game. Fly around a mountain peak and pile
absurd cargo — fridges, pianos, a whole T‑Rex — onto your pack animal's saddle.
The longer you stack without cashing out, the higher your multiplier climbs;
one collapse and everything you hadn't banked is gone. Push your luck.

## Features

- **Real‑time 3D physics** (Godot + Jolt) — pieces glue where they land, wobble,
  and bring the tower down in a cascade when you overreach.
- **A greed loop** — every piece pays out at a climbing multiplier
  (×1 → ×1.5 → ×2 → … → ×18). Cash out to bank it safely and reset, or risk it
  for more. A collapse forfeits only the un‑banked pot.
- **Spin the wheel** — each piece can roll a modifier: Tiny, Massive, Heavy,
  Slippery, or Super Glue.
- **A shop** — spend banked cash on new **mounts** (goat, horse, stag, bull,
  motorcycle, elephant) that replace the donkey, and on saddle **skins**.
- **A daily challenge** — 20 goals that rotate one per day.
- **Photo mode** — frame your tower and save a postcard to an in‑game gallery.
- **Atmosphere** — a peak above an endless sea of clouds, distant ranges, and
  random fly‑bys (eagles, hot‑air balloons, fireworks, the odd UFO).
